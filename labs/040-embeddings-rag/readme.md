# Embeddings and RAG

## Introduction

This examples demonstrates the core principles of the _Retrieval Augmented Generation_ (RAG) pattern. You learn how to call OpenAI's _embeddings_ endpoint and how to use the _RAG_ model to generate text based on a given prompt.

The sample covers the following topics:

* Calling the _embeddings_ endpoint
* Use the dot product to calculate the similarity between two vectors
* Use the _RAG_ model to generate text based on a given prompt

## Exercises

* Make yourself familiar with the code in [_src_](./src).
* Try the prompts offered by the app (part of [_main.ts_](./src/main.ts)).
* Come up with additional queries about the product models.
* Think about an application of function calling that would be relevant to your business or personal life.

## Advanced Exercises

* Combine the RAG model for product search with function calling (e.g. to retrieve pricing information for a product).
