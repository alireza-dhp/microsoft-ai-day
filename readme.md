## Sample Data

The hands-on-labs in this repo use the [_Adventure Works LT_ sample database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure). If you participate in the official hackathon, your trainers will provide a connection string to an instance of _Adventure Works LT_ in Azure. If you work on the samples at home, [install _Adventure Works LT_ in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms#deploy-to-azure-sql-database) or on a [local SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms#restore-to-sql-server).

We recommend to install [_Azure Data Studio_](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-studio) to interactively explore the sample database. Alternatively, you can use [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).
